# Green Hash Bloom 🌿

**Green Hash Bloom** is a blockchain-powered carbon offset marketplace that connects climate-conscious individuals with ESG-focused companies. By tokenizing real-world trees as NFTs, we enable anyone to own a tree, earn annual carbon credits, and participate in a transparent, verifiable carbon credit economy.

## 🌍 Vision

Help individuals and companies offset their CO₂ footprint by bringing tree ownership and carbon sequestration onto the blockchain. We create a direct, trustless bridge between:
- **Tree owners** (individuals who buy and hold tree NFTs)
- **Companies** seeking high-quality, verifiable carbon credits to meet their sustainability goals

Each tree NFT represents:
1. **Real timber value** – redeemable when the tree is responsibly harvested in the distant future
2. **Annual carbon credit tokens** – issued based on the tree’s verified CO₂ sequestration each year

These carbon credits can be held or sold on our built-in marketplace to companies looking to offset emissions.

## ✨ Key Features

- Mint tree NFTs backed by real, geo-tagged trees
- Automatic yearly issuance of carbon credit tokens per tree
- Transparent marketplace to buy/sell carbon credits
- Full on-chain ownership and credit provenance
- Built on Hedera Testnet (EVM-compatible) for speed, low cost, and finality
